# a humble nixos config

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This is my [NixOS](https://nixos.org) 25.11 configuration for both my laptop and desktop.

It includes a near-stock [GNOME](https://gnome.org) desktop environment with a few tweaks to make it a bit more cohesive.

Features:
 - Personal info config file for user-specific items
 - Adwaita GTK3/QT theme, blurred GNOME Shell
 - Minimal & secure Firefox w/GNOME theme & select extensions
 - Zed w/Adwaita Theme
